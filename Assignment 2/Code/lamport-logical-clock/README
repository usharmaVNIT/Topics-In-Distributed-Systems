This is Question 2
    Program to implement Lamportâ€™s Logical Clock Algorithm

All the code is inside Node Folder
I have used Node.js as the programming language and i am using HTTP as
the mode of Communication
On your Computer first run 
    npm install
to install necessary packages
mentioned in package.json

then in seperate terminal windows run
    node process1.js
    node process2.js
    node process3.js


I have also written a code in python inside Python folder which uses interprocess communication instead of http or sockets ..
use python3
    python3 lamportClock.py
